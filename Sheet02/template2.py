# ==========================================================

# TODO: 1. Load the two grayscale images (1.png and 2.png)
# TODO: 2. Compute magnitude and phase of both images
# TODO: 3. Swap magnitude and phase between the two images
# TODO: 4. Reconstruct and save the swapped results
# TODO: 5. Compute and print the MAD values between originals and reconstructions
# TODO: 6. Visualize all images (originals, magnitude, phase, reconstructions)
